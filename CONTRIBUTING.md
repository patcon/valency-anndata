# How To Contribute

There are perhaps two different paths, based on your personal preferences:
- A. Coding: Get into the code and get to a small pull request ASAP, or
- B. Learning: Spend some time learning the context and ecosystem of the project.

Both are great approaches, depending on whether you like working inside-to-out (actions, then context) or outside-to-in (context, then action).

## A. Action: Code First

Small things we need done: (these will move to pull requests soon)
- [ ] some simple tests of existing functionality
- [ ] CI running on GitHub actions, running a basic install on a few versions of Python
- [ ] a simple documentation website using mkdocs (e.g., front-page from README + API page)

See [`TODO.md`](./TODO.md) or ask patcon for other ideas!

## B. Learning: Context First
- [ ] Watch a video about the internals of Pol.is
    - Video: [Pol.is Explainer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrIin_omVn4) (40 min)
- [ ] Watch this video about polislike tools from Hackers on Planet Earth (HOPE) 2024 conference
    - Video: [A Revolution in Representation: Computation Comes to Democracy's Aid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2DXwPDcJ1U) (55 min)
- [ ] Review a flowchart of the Polis data processing pipeline

- [ ] Perform the basic tutorial for scanpy, the tool that inspires this project's approach.
    - Scanpy tutorial: [Preprocessing and clustering](https://scanpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/basics/clustering.html)
    - Use [Google CoLab](https://colab.research.google.com/)'s Notebook environment to run through it in the browser
- [ ] Open and play around with valency-anndata's own Python Notebook
